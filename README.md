# HubSpot Multi-language/multi-region Sample Theme

This is a HubSpot CMS Hub theme based on the [@hubspot/session](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/building-blocks/themes/default-themes#session-theme) theme.

It aims to demonstrate the multi-region/multi-language functionality described in this accompanying blog post: [Tech log: How to build a custom HubSpot multiregion site](https://www.columbiaroad.com/blog/tech-log-how-to-build-a-custom-hubspot-multiregion-site).

For code-diggers: note that the multi-region code was quickly extracted and adapted from another project where this solution was applied. It contains some unneeded code (especially CSS) that was not cleaned up. Apologies in advance!
